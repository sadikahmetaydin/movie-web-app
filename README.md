# MovieBox - Movie Website App ✨

Discover Movie App is a sleek and interactive web application designed to help users explore movies in a fun and effortless way. Instead of searching manually, users are presented with a randomized selection of films fetched directly from the TMDB (The Movie Database) API. Each movie card displays essential information such as the poster, title, release year, and a brief overview.

Upon clicking a movie, users are taken to a detailed page where they can view extended information including runtime and description. If a movie catches their interest, they can add it to their personal favorites list with a single click. These favorites are stored locally in the browser, ensuring they remain available even after the page is refreshed or revisited later.

The app features a clean and responsive design built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a smooth experience across all devices. Navigation is handled via React Router, allowing seamless transitions between pages like Home, Details, and Favorites.
